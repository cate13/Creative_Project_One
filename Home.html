        Nick and I have always loved dogs. In fact, you can say that it was a dog that brought us together.
    </p>
    <p>
    I was in high school when I asked by mother for a dog. She said no. So, I started feeding a stray that lived
    on our street. The stray, a small pug I named Cory, was a wonderful dog. Then one day I came back and found that
    Cory wasn't were he usually was. I was so worried. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I put up missing posters, with an award, I walked all around my neighborhood calling for Cory. That's when I met Nick.
    </p>
    <p>  
        Nick was out in his yard playing with Cory. I walked up to his yard, really rather mad, and started yelling at him. Please
        remember I was seventeen. I accussed him of stealing my dog. Turns out Cory was his dog, Cory was girl, and Cory's name was 
        Nell.
    </p>
    <p>
        We eventually agreed to dogshare Cory-Nell and well here we are. We take in stray dogs into our lives and 
        try and find good homes for them.

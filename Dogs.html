                Maggie here was a favorite with Mrs. Leonard's grandchildren, but with Mrs. Leonard's advancing age
                a dog isn't practical. Maggie is great with children and well trained.

                Ziggy here used to be a police dog before he lost his hearing. He has been trained to respond
                to hand commands and loves long walks.

                    Rudy is a quiet dog and a bit lazy. Happy to lay around all day, Rudy won't drag
                    you to the park to play fetch.

                Spotty loves to watch 101 Dalmations, and other Disney movies, but mostly 101 Dalmations.
                Weirdly he seems to root for Cruella De Vil.
